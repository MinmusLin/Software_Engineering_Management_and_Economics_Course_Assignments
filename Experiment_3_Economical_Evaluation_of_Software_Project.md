# Experiment 3: Economical Evaluation of Software Project

## 1 Experiment Background and Objectives

### 1.1 Experiment Background

In the field of Software Engineering Economics, evaluating the financial feasibility of a software project is crucial for decision-making. This experiment focuses on conducting an economic evaluation of a software project, aligning with the principles taught in the course “Software Engineering Management and Economics”.

The experiment requires students to analyze their course project from an economic perspective, considering factors such as:

* Market conditions (demand, competition, pricing strategies)
* Cost estimation (development, maintenance, operational expenses)
* Revenue models (licensing, subscriptions, one-time sales)
* Investment and financing (capital sources, ROI calculations)
* Regulatory and tax implications (VAT, corporate income tax)

The goal is to determine whether the proposed software project is economically viable and justify its feasibility using financial metrics.

### 1.2 Experiment Objectives

By completing this experiment, students will:

1. **Master economic modeling techniques** for software project evaluation.
2. **Understand pricing strategies** for software products (e.g., freemium, subscription-based, pay-per-use).
3. **Develop financial analysis skills** by preparing key statements:
   * Investment & cost estimation tables
   * Cash flow projections
   * Profitability analysis (NPV, IRR, payback period)
4. **Evaluate project feasibility** by comparing financial indicators against industry benchmarks.
5. **Enhance decision-making abilities** by determining whether to proceed with, modify, or abandon a project based on economic analysis.

## 2 Experiment Principles

### 2.1 Overview of Economic Evaluation

Economic evaluation in software engineering involves analyzing the financial viability of a project by assessing its costs, revenues, and profitability over its lifecycle. The evaluation follows standard financial models and considers:

* **Time value of money** (discounting future cash flows)
* **Risk and uncertainty** (sensitivity analysis, break-even points)
* **Taxation and regulations** (VAT, corporate tax, depreciation rules)
* **Market conditions** (demand, competition, pricing elasticity)

The goal is to determine whether the project is worth investing in by comparing expected returns against costs and risks.

### 2.2 Key Financial Concepts

1. **Net Present Value (NPV)**
   * Measures the absolute profitability by discounting future cash flows to their present value.
   * Decision rule: Accept if NPV > 0 (profitable).
2. **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**
   * The discount rate that makes NPV = 0.
   * Decision rule: Accept if IRR > required rate of return.
3. **Payback Period**
   * Time needed to recover the initial investment.
   * Decision rule: Shorter payback = lower risk.
4. **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)**
   * Compares total benefits (revenue, efficiency gains) vs. total costs (development, maintenance).
5. **Break-even Analysis**
   * Determines the minimum sales volume needed to cover costs.

### 2.3 Data Requirements

To perform the evaluation, the following data must be collected:

* **Costs**: Development, marketing, maintenance, licensing, infrastructure.
* **Revenue Streams**: Sales, subscriptions, ads, in-app purchases.
* **Investment & Financing**: Capital sources (equity, loans), interest rates.
* **Tax & Depreciation**: Corporate tax rates, asset depreciation schedules.

### 2.4 Evaluation Process

1. **Pre-Financing Analysis** (Profitability without loans)
   * Calculate NPV, IRR, payback period.
   * If results are favorable → proceed to financing options.
   * If unfavorable → revise the business model or abandon.
2. **Post-Financing Analysis** (Including loans & equity)
   * Assess debt repayment capacity.
   * Evaluate return on equity (ROE) for investors.
3. **Sensitivity & Scenario Testing**
   * Test how changes in costs, sales, or interest rates affect profitability.

## 3 Experiment Content and Steps

### 3.1 Defining the Business Objectives

The business objectives of this software project are established based on the course design requirements and economic feasibility analysis. The key objectives include:

The year when cumulative present value turns from negative to positive: **Year 3**

Dynamic Payback Period Formula:

DPP = (Year when cumulative present value turns positive - 1) + (Absolute value of last year's cumulative present value / Current year's discounted net cash flow)

* Dynamic Payback Period DPP = **3.08 years**
* Dynamic Payback Period DPP = **36.96 months**

### 3.5 Post-Financing Analysis

Based on the pre-financing evaluation results (NPV = ¥424,200, IRR = 15.04%, payback period = 4.62 years), the project demonstrates acceptable profitability and meets the minimum financial benchmarks. Therefore, we proceed with post-financing analysis to assess the impact of capital structure (debt and equity) on project viability.

#### 3.5.1 Debt Repayment Capacity

* **Loan Details**:
  * Principal: ¥600,000 (5-year term loan)
  * Annual interest expense: ¥33,000 (implied interest rate ≈ 5.5%)
* **Repayment Schedule**:
  * The loan is fully repaid by Year 5 (see *Auxiliary Statement 3*).
  * Annual operating cash flows (Year 1-5: ¥-969,200 to ¥1,636,400) comfortably cover interest payments.
  * **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)**:
    * Year 3: Operating cash flow (¥353,800) / Debt service (¥33,000) = 10.7x (safe margin).

#### 3.5.2 Return on Equity (ROE)

* **Equity Investment**: ¥120,000 (capital contribution).
* **Net Profit After Tax & Interest**:
  * Year 5: Operating income (¥2,090,000) - Costs (¥716,700) - Taxes (¥137,900) - Interest (¥0) = ¥1,235,400.
* **ROE**: ¥1,235,400 / ¥120,000 ≈ 1029% (cumulative over 5 years), demonstrating high investor returns.

#### 3.5.3 Leverage Impact on Financial Metrics

* **NPV with Financing Costs**: Remains positive (¥424,200), confirming debt does not erode value.
* **IRR (15.04%)** exceeds the loan interest rate (5.5%), indicating favorable leverage.

#### 3.5.4 Sensitivity Testing

* **Worst-Case Scenario** (20% revenue decline + 2% interest rate hike):
  * NPV drops to ~¥250,000 but stays positive.
  * The payback period extends to ~5.3 years (still acceptable).

#### 3.5.5 Decision Recommendation

* **Proceed with Financing**: The project maintains robust profitability and debt repayment capacity.
* **Risk Mitigation**:
  * Maintain a cash reserve for potential revenue volatility.
  * Explore refinancing options if interest rates rise significantly.

**Conclusion**: The project is financially viable post-financing and warrants implementation.

## 5 Experiment Discussion

For software projects/products that do not generate direct cash revenue (e.g., internal tools, open-source projects, or public infrastructure), alternative evaluation methods should be employed:

1. **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)**
   * Quantify non-monetary benefits:
     * Efficiency gains (time savings × labor costs)
     * Risk reduction (e.g., security improvements)
     * Compliance benefits (avoided penalties)
2. **Return on Objectives (ROO)**
   * Measure achievement of strategic goals:
     * User adoption rates
     * Process automation levels
     * Quality improvement metrics
3. **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)**
   * Scorecard approach evaluating:
     * Technical feasibility (0-10 scale)
     * Organizational alignment
     * Social/environmental impact
4. **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**
   * Compare against alternatives:
     * Development vs. commercial solution costs
     * Long-term maintenance implications
5. **Value Engineering**
   * Function-based analysis:
     * Essential functions delivered per unit cost
     * Eliminate low-value features

Example Framework for Non-Revenue Projects:

| Metric | Weight | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Process Efficiency | 40% | Hours saved/month |
| Risk Mitigation | 30% | % reduction in incidents |
| Strategic Alignment | 20% | Leadership score (1-5) |
| Compliance | 10% | Audit pass rate |
